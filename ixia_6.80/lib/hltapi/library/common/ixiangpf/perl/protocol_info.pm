##Procedure Header
# Name:
#    ixiangpf::protocol_info
#
# Description:
#    This method can be used to get session status statistics for NGPF protocols that support start and stop operations.
#
# Synopsis:
#    ixiangpf::protocol_info
#x       [-handle      ANY]
#x       [-port_filter ANY]
#x       -mode         CHOICES aggregate handles
#
# Arguments:
#x   -handle
#x       A handle or list of handles that correspond to NGPF protocols.
#x       If an invalid handle is given, a warning will be printed to the console and the corresponding handle will be ignored.
#x       If the argument is omitted, the command will return the status of all NGPF protocols that are found.
#x   -port_filter
#x       A port handle, virtual port handle or a list containing any combination of port handles and virtual ports.
#x       The ports that correspond to the specified handles will be used to filter the results of the command. If any of the specified handles does not match any of the port filters, no information about the sessions configured on that handle will be returned.
#x       If an invalid port is specified, the command will return an error.
#x   -mode
#x       Specifies the retrieval mode as either aggregate for all configured sessions or on a per session basis.
#
