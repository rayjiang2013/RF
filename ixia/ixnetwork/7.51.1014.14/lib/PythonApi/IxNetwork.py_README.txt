Manual File Installation
--------------------------------
At this time there is no installer so the user will need to manually install the IxNetwork.py file. Normally the file will be installed to the standard location for third-party Python modules. This location varies by platform and by how you built/installed Python itself. On Unix (and Mac OS X, which is also Unix-based), it also depends on whether the module distribution being installed is pure Python or contains extensions (“non-pure”).  

Copy the IxNetwork.py file from the location in which this IxNetwork.py_README.txt is found to your <Python.X.Y Base Directory>/lib/site-packages location or for more details review the following link: http://docs.python.org/2/install/#how-installation-works
