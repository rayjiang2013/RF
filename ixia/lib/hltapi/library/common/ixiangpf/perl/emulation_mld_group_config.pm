##Procedure Header
# Name:
#    ixiangpf::emulation_mld_group_config
#
# Description:
#    Configures multicast groups added to an MLD session.  This procedure
#    utilizes the common emulation_multicast_group_config and
#    emulation_multicast_source_config procedures.

#
# Arguments:
#    -mode
#        This option defines the action to be taken.
#x   -return_detailed_handles
#x       This argument determines if individual interface, session or router handles are returned by the current command.
#x       This applies only to the command on which it is specified.
#x       Setting this to 0 means that only NGPF-specific protocol stack handles will be returned. This will significantly
#x       decrease the size of command results and speed up script execution.
#x       The default is 0, meaning only protocol stack handles will be returned.
#n   -g_enable_packing
#n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
#x   -g_filter_mode
#x       Cofigure MLDv2 Include Filter Mode. This is valid only for IxTclNetwork API.
#x       If this parameter is not provided, the filter_mode that was set at host level will be used instead.
#n   -g_max_groups_per_pkts
#n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
#n   -g_max_sources_per_group
#n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
#    -group_pool_handle
#        Groups to be linked to the session in create mode. The group pool
#        must be added beforehand through procedure
#        emulation_multicast_group_config.
#    -handle
#        Group membership handle that associates group pools with an MLD
#        session. If modify mode, membership handle must be used to identify the multicast group pools.
#x   -no_of_grp_ranges
#x       Number of MLD multicast groups in group pool.
#x   -no_of_src_ranges
#x       Number of MLD unicast sources in source pool.
#n   -no_write
#n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
#x   -reset
#x       If the -mode is create and this option exists, then any existing group ranges (for the specified -session_handle mld host) will
#x       be deleted before creating new ones. This option is available
#x       only for IxNetwork Tcl API.
#    -session_handle
#        MLD Host handle on which to configure the MLD group ranges.
#    -source_pool_handle
#        Associate source pool(s) with group(s). Specify one or more source pool
#        handle(s) for (S,G) entries. None for (*,G) entries. The source pool(s)
#        must be added beforehand through procedure
#        emulation_multicast_source_config.
#x   -filter_mode
#x       Configure MLDv2 Include Filter Mode.
#
# Return Values:
#    A list containing the mld source protocol stack handles that were added by the command (if any).
#x   key:mld_source_handle  value:A list containing the mld source protocol stack handles that were added by the command (if any).
#    $::SUCCESS | $::FAILURE
#    key:status             value:$::SUCCESS | $::FAILURE
#    When status is failure, contains more info
#    key:log                value:When status is failure, contains more info
#    The group member handle Please note that this key will be omitted if the current session or command were run with -return_detailed_handles 0.
#    key:handle             value:The group member handle Please note that this key will be omitted if the current session or command were run with -return_detailed_handles 0.
#    The group pool handle
#    key:mld_group_handle   value:The group pool handle
#    Source pool handles list Please note that this key will be omitted if the current session or command were run with -return_detailed_handles 0.
#    key:source_handle      value:Source pool handles list Please note that this key will be omitted if the current session or command were run with -return_detailed_handles 0.
#
# Examples:
#    See files starting with MLD_ in the Samples subdirectory.
#    See the MLD example in Appendix A, "Example APIs," for one specific example usage.
#
# Sample Input:
#
# Sample Output:
#    {status $::SUCCESS} {mld_groups {routeRange1 routeRange2}}
#
# Notes:
#    1) Not yet coded to functional specification.
#    2) MLD implementation using IxTclNetwork is NOT SUPPORTED in HLTAPI 3.20.
#    If the current session or command was run with -return_detailed_handles 0 the following keys will be omitted from the command response:  handle, source_handle
