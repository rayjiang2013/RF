.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR is a Perl source code analyzer.  It is the executable
front-end to the Perl::Critic engine, which attempts
to identify awkward, hard to read, error-prone, or unconventional
constructs in your code.  Most of the rules are based on Damian
Conway's book \fBPerl Best Practices\fR.  However, \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR is
\&\fBnot\fR limited to enforcing \s-1PBP,\s0 and it will even support rules that
contradict Conway.  All rules can easily be configured or disabled to
your liking.
.PP
This documentation only covers how to drive this command.  For all
other information, including how to persistently configure this
command so that you don't have to say so much on the command-line, see
the documentation for Perl::Critic itself.
.SH "USAGE EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "USAGE EXAMPLES"
Before getting into all the gory details, here are some basic usage
examples to help get you started.

.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.IX Header "ARGUMENTS"
The arguments are paths to the files you wish to analyze.  You may
specify multiple files.  If an argument is a directory, \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR
will analyze all Perl files below the directory.  If no arguments are
specified, then input is read from \s-1STDIN.\s0
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Option names can be abbreviated to uniqueness and can be stated with
singe or double dashes, and option values can be separated from the
option name by a space or '=' (as with Getopt::Long).
Option names are also case-sensitive.
.ie n .IP """\-\-profile FILE"" or ""\-p FILE""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-profile FILE\fR or \f(CW\-p FILE\fR" 4
.IX Item "--profile FILE or -p FILE"
Directs \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR to use a profile named by \s-1FILE\s0 rather than
looking for the default \fI.perlcriticrc\fR file in the current directory
or your home directory.  See \*(L"\s-1CONFIGURATION\*(R"\s0 in Perl::Critic for more
information.
.ie n .IP """\-\-noprofile""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-noprofile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--noprofile"
Directs \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR not to load any configuration file, thus
reverting to the default configuration for all Policies.
.ie n .IP """\-\-severity N""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-severity N\fR" 4
.IX Item "--severity N"
Directs \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR to only apply Policies with a severity greater
than \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR.  Severity values are integers ranging from 1 (least severe)
to 5 (most severe).  The default is 5.  For a given \f(CW\*(C`\-\-profile\*(C'\fR,
decreasing the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-severity\*(C'\fR will usually produce more violations.
You can set the default value for this option in your \fI.perlcriticrc\fR
file.  You can also redefine the \f(CW\*(C`severity\*(C'\fR for any Policy in your
\&\fI.perlcriticrc\fR file.  See \*(L"\s-1CONFIGURATION\*(R"\s0 for more information.
.ie n .IP """\-5 | \-4 | \-3 | \-2 | \-1""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-5 | \-4 | \-3 | \-2 | \-1\fR" 4
.IX Item "-5 | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1"
These are numeric shortcuts for setting the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-severity\*(C'\fR option.  For
example, \f(CW"\-4"\fR is equivalent to \f(CW"\-\-severity 4"\fR.  If multiple
shortcuts are specified, then the most restrictive one wins.  If an
explicit \f(CW\*(C`\-\-severity\*(C'\fR option is also given, then all shortcut options
are silently ignored.  \s-1NOTE:\s0 Be careful not to put one of the number
severity shortcut options immediately after the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-top\*(C'\fR flag or
\&\f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR will interpret it as the number of violations to report.
.ie n .IP """\-\-severity NAME""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-severity NAME\fR" 4
.IX Item "--severity NAME"
If it is difficult for you to remember whether severity \*(L"5\*(R" is the
most or least restrictive level, then you can use one of these named
values:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    SEVERITY NAME   ...is equivalent to...   SEVERITY NUMBER
\&    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

\&    \-\-severity stern                            \-\-severity 4
\&    \-\-severity harsh                            \-\-severity 3
\&    \-\-severity cruel                            \-\-severity 2
\&    \-\-severity brutal                           \-\-severity 1
.Ve
.ie n .IP """\-\-gentle | \-\-stern | \-\-harsh | \-\-cruel | \-\-brutal""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-gentle | \-\-stern | \-\-harsh | \-\-cruel | \-\-brutal\fR" 4
.IX Item "--gentle | --stern | --harsh | --cruel | --brutal"
These are named shortcuts for setting the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-severity\*(C'\fR option.  For
example, \f(CW"\-\-cruel"\fR is equivalent to \f(CW"\-\-severity 2"\fR.  If multiple
shortcuts are specified, then the most restrictive one wins.  If an
explicit \f(CW\*(C`\-\-severity\*(C'\fR option is also given, then all shortcut options
are silently ignored.
.ie n .IP """\-\-theme RULE""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-theme RULE\fR" 4
.IX Item "--theme RULE"
Directs \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR to apply only Policies with themes that satisfy
the \f(CW\*(C`RULE\*(C'\fR.  Themes are arbitrary names for groups of related
policies.  You can combine theme names with boolean operators to
create an arbitrarily complex \f(CW\*(C`RULE\*(C'\fR.  For example, the following
would apply only Policies that have a 'bugs' \s-1AND \s0'pbp' theme:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $> perlcritic \-\-theme=\*(Aqbugs && pbp\*(Aq MyModule.pm
.Ve
.Sp
Unless the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-severity\*(C'\fR option is explicitly given, setting
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-theme\*(C'\fR silently causes the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-severity\*(C'\fR to be set to 1.  You can
set the default value for this option in your \fI.perlcriticrc\fR file.
See \*(L"\s-1POLICY THEMES\*(R"\s0 in Perl::Critic for more information about themes.
.ie n .IP """\-\-include PATTERN""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-include PATTERN\fR" 4
.IX Item "--include PATTERN"
Directs \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR to apply additional Policies that match the
regex \f(CW\*(C`/PATTERN/imx\*(C'\fR.  Use this option to temporarily override your
profile and/or the severity settings at the command-line.  For
example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perlcritic \-\-include=layout my_file.pl
.Ve
.Sp
This would cause \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR to apply all the \f(CW\*(C`CodeLayout::*\*(C'\fR
policies even if they have a severity level that is less than the
default level of 5, or have been disabled in your \fI.perlcriticrc\fR
file.  You can specify multiple \f(CW\*(C`\-\-include\*(C'\fR options and you can use
it in conjunction with the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-exclude\*(C'\fR option.  Note that
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-exclude\*(C'\fR takes precedence over \f(CW\*(C`\-\-include\*(C'\fR when a Policy matches
both patterns.  You can set the default value for this option in your
\&\fI.perlcriticrc\fR file.
.ie n .IP """\-\-exclude PATTERN""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-exclude PATTERN\fR" 4
.IX Item "--exclude PATTERN"
Directs \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR to not apply any Policy that matches the regex
\&\f(CW\*(C`/PATTERN/imx\*(C'\fR.  Use this option to temporarily override your profile
and/or the severity settings at the command-line.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perlcritic \-\-exclude=strict my_file.pl
.Ve
.Sp
This would cause \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR to not apply the \f(CW\*(C`RequireUseStrict\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`ProhibitNoStrict\*(C'\fR Policies even though they have the highest
severity level.  You can specify multiple \f(CW\*(C`\-\-exclude\*(C'\fR options and you
can use it in conjunction with the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-include\*(C'\fR option.  Note that
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-exclude\*(C'\fR takes precedence over \f(CW\*(C`\-\-include\*(C'\fR when a Policy matches
both patterns.  You can set the default value for this option in your
\&\fI.perlcriticrc\fR file.
.ie n .IP """\-\-single\-policy PATTERN"" or ""\-s PATTERN""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-single\-policy PATTERN\fR or \f(CW\-s PATTERN\fR" 4
.IX Item "--single-policy PATTERN or -s PATTERN"
Directs \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR to apply just one Policy module matching the
regex \f(CW\*(C`/PATTERN/ixms\*(C'\fR, and exclude all other Policies.  This option
has precedence over the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-severity\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-\-theme\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-\-include\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-exclude\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-only\*(C'\fR options.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perlcritic \-\-single\-policy=nowarnings my_file.pl
.Ve
.Sp
This would cause \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR to apply just the \f(CW\*(C`ProhibitNoWarnings\*(C'\fR
Policy, regardless of the severity level setting.  No other Policies
would be applied.
.Sp
This is equivalent to what one might intend by...
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perlcritic \-\-exclude=. \-\-include=nowarnings my_file.pl
.Ve
.Sp
\&... but this won't work because the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-exclude\*(C'\fR option overrides the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-include\*(C'\fR option.
.Sp
The equivalent of this option can be accomplished by creating a custom
profile containing only the desired policy and then running...
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    perlcritic \-\-profile=customprofile \-\-only my_file.pl
.Ve
.ie n .IP """\-\-top [ N ]""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-top [ N ]\fR" 4
.IX Item "--top [ N ]"
Directs \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR to report only the top \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR Policy violations in
each file, ranked by their severity.  If \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR is not specified, it
defaults to 20.  If the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-severity\*(C'\fR option (or one of the shortcuts)
is not explicitly given, the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-top\*(C'\fR option implies that the minimum
severity level is \*(L"1\*(R" (i.e. \*(L"brutal\*(R"). Users can redefine the severity
for any Policy in their \fI.perlcriticrc\fR file.  See \*(L"\s-1CONFIGURATION\*(R"\s0
for more information.  You can set the default value for this option
in your \fI.perlcriticrc\fR file.  \s-1NOTE:\s0 Be careful not to put one of the
severity shortcut options immediately after the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-top\*(C'\fR flag or
\&\f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR will interpret it as the number of violations to report.
.ie n .IP """\-\-force""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-force\fR" 4
.IX Item "--force"
Directs \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR to ignore the magical \f(CW"## no critic"\fR
annotations in the source code. See \*(L"\s-1BENDING THE RULES\*(R"\s0 for more
information.  You can set the default value for this option in your
\&\fI.perlcriticrc\fR file.
.ie n .IP """\-\-statistics""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-statistics\fR" 4
.IX Item "--statistics"
Causes several statistics about the code being scanned and the
violations found to be reported after any other output.
.ie n .IP """\-\-statistics\-only""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-statistics\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "--statistics-only"
Like the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-statistics\*(C'\fR option, but suppresses normal output and only
shows the statistics.
.ie n .IP """\-\-verbose N | FORMAT""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-verbose N | FORMAT\fR" 4
.IX Item "--verbose N | FORMAT"
Sets the verbosity level or format for reporting violations.  If given
a number (\f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR), \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR reports violations using one of the
predefined formats described below.  If given a string (\f(CW\*(C`FORMAT\*(C'\fR), it
is interpreted to be an actual format specification.  If the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-verbose\*(C'\fR option is not specified, it defaults to either 4 or 5,
depending on whether multiple files were given as arguments to
\&\f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR.  You can set the default value for this option in your

that the Policy supports.  The format is suitable as a prototype for
your \fI.perlcriticrc\fR file.
.ie n .IP """\-\-only""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW\-\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "--only"
Directs perlcritic to apply only Policies that are explicitly
mentioned in your \fI.perlcriticrc\fR file.  This is useful if you want
to use just a small subset of Policies without having to disable all
the others.  You can set the default value for this option in your

Directs perlcritic how to treat certain recoverable problems found in
a \fI.perlcriticrc\fR or file specified via the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-profile\*(C'\fR option.
Valid values are \f(CW\*(C`warn\*(C'\fR (the default), \f(CW\*(C`fatal\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`quiet\*(C'\fR.  For
example, perlcritic normally only warns about profiles referring to

marked as \*(L"unsafe\*(R".  Unsafe Policies may result in risky operations by
compiling and executing the code they analyze.  All the Policies that ship in
the core Perl::Critic distribution are safe.  However,
third-party Policies, such as those in the
Perl::Critic::Dynamic distribution are not safe.
Note that \*(L"safety\*(R" is honorary \*(-- if a Policy author marks a Policy as safe,

.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
Most of the settings for Perl::Critic and each of the Policy modules
can be controlled by a configuration file.  The default configuration
file is called \fI.perlcriticrc\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR will look for this
file in the current directory first, and then in your home directory.
Alternatively, you can set the \f(CW\*(C`PERLCRITIC\*(C'\fR environment variable to
explicitly point to a different file in another location.  If none of
these files exist, and the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-profile\*(C'\fR option is not given on the
command-line, then all Policies will be loaded with their default
configuration.
.PP
The format of the configuration file is a series of INI-style blocks
that contain key-value pairs separated by \*(L"=\*(R". Comments should start
with \*(L"#\*(R" and can be placed on a separate line or after the name-value
pairs if you desire.
.PP
Default settings for perlcritic itself can be set \fBbefore the first
named block.\fR For example, putting any or all of these at the top of
your \fI.perlcriticrc\fR file will set the default value for the
corresponding command-line argument.

.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl::Critic::Policy::Category::PolicyName\*(C'\fR is the full name of a
module that implements the policy.  The Policy modules distributed
with Perl::Critic have been grouped into categories according to the
table of contents in Damian Conway's book \fBPerl Best Practices\fR. For
brevity, you can omit the \f(CW\*(AqPerl::Critic::Policy\*(Aq\fR part of the module
name.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`severity\*(C'\fR is the level of importance you wish to assign to the
Policy.  All Policy modules are defined with a default severity value
ranging from 1 (least severe) to 5 (most severe).  However, you may
disagree with the default severity and choose to give it a higher or
lower severity, based on your own coding philosophy.  You can set the
\&\f(CW\*(C`severity\*(C'\fR to an integer from 1 to 5, or use one of the equivalent
names:
.PP
.Vb 7

.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`set_themes\*(C'\fR sets the theme for the Policy and overrides its default
theme.  The argument is a string of one or more whitespace-delimited
alphanumeric words.  Themes are case-insensitive.  See \*(L"\s-1POLICY
THEMES\*(R"\s0 for more information.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`add_themes\*(C'\fR appends to the default themes for this Policy.  The
argument is a string of one or more whitespace-delimited words.
Themes are case-insensitive.  See \*(L"\s-1POLICY THEMES\*(R"\s0 for more
information.
.PP
The remaining key-value pairs are configuration parameters that will
be passed into the constructor of that Policy.  The constructors for
most Policy modules do not support arguments, and those that do should
have reasonable defaults.  See the documentation on the appropriate
Policy module for more details.
.PP
Instead of redefining the severity for a given Policy, you can
completely disable a Policy by prepending a '\-' to the name of the
module in your configuration file.  In this manner, the Policy will
never be loaded, regardless of the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-severity\*(C'\fR given on the command
line.

.SH "THE POLICIES"

A large number of Policy modules are distributed with Perl::Critic.
They are described briefly in the companion document

detail in the individual modules themselves.  Say \f(CW"perlcritic \-\-doc

regex \f(CW\*(C`m/PATTERN/ixms\*(C'\fR
.PP
There are a number of distributions of additional policies on \s-1CPAN.\s0
If Perl::Critic doesn't contain a policy that you
want, some one may have already written it.  See \*(L"\s-1SEE
ALSO\*(R"\s0 in Perl::Critic for a list of some of these distributions.
.SH "POLICY THEMES"
.IX Header "POLICY THEMES"
Each Policy is defined with one or more \*(L"themes\*(R".  Themes can be used
to create arbitrary groups of Policies.  They are intended to provide
an alternative mechanism for selecting your preferred set of Policies.
For example, you may wish disable a certain set of Policies when
analyzing test programs.  Conversely, you may wish to enable only a
specific subset of Policies when analyzing modules.
.PP
The Policies that ship with Perl::Critic are have been divided into
the following themes.  This is just our attempt to provide some basic
logical groupings.  You are free to invent new themes that suit your
needs.

.Ve

Say \f(CW"perlcritic \-\-list"\fR to get a listing of all available policies

.PP
Using the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-theme\*(C'\fR command-line option, you can create an
arbitrarily complex rule that determines which Policies to apply.
Precedence is the same as regular Perl code, and you can use
parentheses to enforce precedence as well.  Supported operators are:

.SH "BENDING THE RULES"
.IX Header "BENDING THE RULES"
Perl::Critic takes a hard-line approach to your code: either you
comply or you don't.  In the real world, it is not always practical
(or even possible) to fully comply with coding standards.  In such
cases, it is wise to show that you are knowingly violating the
standards and that you have a Damn Good Reason (\s-1DGR\s0) for doing so.
.PP
To help with those situations, you can direct Perl::Critic to ignore
certain lines or blocks of code by using annotations:
.PP

\&      ## no critic
\&
\&      $foo = "";               #Violates \*(AqProhibitEmptyQuotes\*(Aq
\&      $barf = bar() if $foo;   #Violates \*(AqProhibitPostfixControls\*(Aq
\&      #Some more evil code...

.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW"## no critic"\fR annotations direct Perl::Critic to ignore the remaining
lines of code until a \f(CW"## use critic"\fR annotation is found. If the \f(CW"## no
critic"\fR annotation is on the same line as a code statement, then only that
line of code is overlooked.  To direct perlcritic to ignore the \f(CW"## no
critic"\fR annotations, use the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-force\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
A bare \f(CW"## no critic"\fR annotation disables all the active Policies.  If
you wish to disable only specific Policies, add a list of Policy names
as arguments just as you would for the \f(CW"no strict"\fR or \f(CW"no
warnings"\fR pragma.  For example, this would disable the
\&\f(CW\*(C`ProhibitEmptyQuotes\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ProhibitPostfixControls\*(C'\fR policies until
the end of the block or until the next \f(CW"## use critic"\fR annotation
(whichever comes first):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ## no critic (EmptyQuotes, PostfixControls);
\&
\&    # Now exempt from ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitEmptyQuotes
\&    $foo = "";
\&
\&    # Now exempt ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls
\&    $barf = bar() if $foo;
\&
\&    # Still subject to ValuesAndExpression::RequireNumberSeparators
\&    $long_int = 10000000000;
.Ve
.PP
Since the Policy names are matched against the \f(CW"## no critic"\fR
arguments as regular expressions, you can abbreviate the Policy names
or disable an entire family of Policies in one shot like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ## no critic (NamingConventions)
\&
\&    # Now exempt from NamingConventions::Capitalization
\&    my $camelHumpVar = \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq;
\&
\&    # Now exempt from NamingConventions::Capitalization
\&    sub camelHumpSub {}
.Ve
.PP
The argument list must be enclosed in parentheses and must contain one
or more comma-separated barewords (i.e. don't use quotes).  The \f(CW"##
no critic"\fR annotations can be nested, and Policies named by an inner
annotation will be disabled along with those already disabled an outer
annotation.
.PP
Some Policies like \f(CW\*(C`Subroutines::ProhibitExcessComplexity\*(C'\fR apply to
an entire block of code.  In those cases, \f(CW"## no critic"\fR must
appear on the line where the violation is reported.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    sub complicated_function {  ## no critic (ProhibitExcessComplexity)
\&        # Your code here...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Some Policies like \f(CW\*(C`Documentation::RequirePodSections\*(C'\fR apply to the
entire document, in which case violations are reported at line 1.  But
if the file requires a shebang line, it is impossible to put \f(CW"## no
critic"\fR on the first line of the file.  This is a known limitation
and it will be addressed in a future release.  As a workaround, you
can disable the affected policies at the command-line or in your
\&\fI.perlcriticrc\fR file.  But beware that this will affect the analysis
of \fBall\fR files.
.PP
Use this feature wisely.  \f(CW"## no critic"\fR should be used in the
smallest possible scope, or only on individual lines of code. And you
should always be as specific as possible about which policies you want
to disable (i.e. never use a bare \f(CW"## no critic"\fR).  If Perl::Critic
complains about your code, try and find a compliant solution before
resorting to this feature.
.SH "EDITOR INTEGRATION"
.IX Header "EDITOR INTEGRATION"
For ease-of-use, \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR can be integrated with your favorite
text editor.  The output-formatting capabilities of \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR are
specifically intended for use with the \*(L"grep\*(R" or \*(L"compile\*(R" modes
available in editors like \f(CW\*(C`emacs\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`vim\*(C'\fR.  In these modes, you
can run an arbitrary command and the editor will parse the output into
an interactive buffer that you can click on and jump to the relevant
line of code.
.PP
The Perl::Critic team thanks everyone who has helped integrate Perl-Critic
with their favorite editor.  Your contributions in particular have made
Perl-Critic a convenient and user-friendly tool for Perl developers of all
stripes.  We sincerely appreciate your hard work.
.SS "\s-1EMACS\s0"
.IX Subsection "EMACS"
Joshua ben Jore has authored a minor-mode for emacs that allows you to
run perlcritic on the current region or buffer.  You can run it on
demand, or configure it to run automatically when you save the buffer.
The output appears in a hot-linked compiler buffer.  The code and
installation instructions can be found in the \fIextras\fR directory
inside this distribution.

If \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR has any errors itself, exits with status == 1.  If
there are no errors, but \f(CW\*(C`perlcritic\*(C'\fR finds Policy violations in your
source code, exits with status == 2.  If there were no errors and no
violations were found, exits with status == 0.
.SH "THE Perl::Critic PHILOSOPHY"
.IX Header "THE Perl::Critic PHILOSOPHY"
.RS 4
Coding standards are deeply personal and highly subjective.  The goal
of Perl::Critic is to help you write code that conforms with a set of
best practices.  Our primary goal is not to dictate what those
practices are, but rather, to implement the practices discovered by
others.  Ultimately, you make the rules \*(-- Perl::Critic is merely a
tool for encouraging consistency.  If there is a policy that you think
is important or that we have overlooked, we would be very grateful for
contributions, or you can simply load your own private set of policies
into Perl::Critic.
.RE
.SH "EXTENDING THE CRITIC"
.IX Header "EXTENDING THE CRITIC"
The modular design of Perl::Critic is intended to facilitate the
addition of new Policies.  You'll need to have some understanding of
\&\s-1PPI\s0, but most Policy modules are pretty straightforward and
only require about 20 lines of code, and half of those lines are
simple use statements and simple declarations..  Please see the
Perl::Critic::DEVELOPER file included in
this distribution for a step-by-step demonstration of how to create
new Policy modules.
.PP
If you develop any new Policy modules, feel free to send them to \f(CW\*(C`<jeff@imaginative\-software.com>\*(C'\fR and I'll be happy to put them into the
Perl::Critic distribution.  Or if you would like to work on the
Perl::Critic project directly, check out our repository at
<http://perlcritic.tigris.org>.  To subscribe to our mailing list,
send a message to <mailto:dev\-subscribe@perlcritic.tigris.org>.
.PP
The Perl::Critic team is also available for hire.  If your
organization has its own coding standards, we can create custom
Policies to enforce your local guidelines.  Or if your code base is
prone to a particular defect pattern, we can design Policies that will
help you catch those costly defects \fBbefore\fR they go into production.
